## üìö Historical Context

### Medieval Wales: A Celtic Kingdom in Transition (867-1453)
Medieval Wales was a complex mosaic of independent principalities, each maintaining distinct Celtic traditions while adapting to the changing political landscape of medieval Britain. Unlike the centralized kingdoms of England or France, Wales preserved a decentralized political structure rooted in ancient Celtic customs and law.

#### The Four Great Kingdoms
- **Gwynedd** (North Wales): The most powerful Welsh kingdom, centered in Snowdonia with its court at Aberffraw
- **Powys** (Central Wales): Strategic border kingdom controlling the central valleys and marches
- **Deheubarth** (South Wales): Southern kingdom encompassing the fertile lands of ancient Dyfed and Seisyllwg
- **Morgannwg/Glamorgan** (Southeast Wales): Kingdom of Gwent and Glywysing, often caught between Welsh and Norman influences

### Cultural Distinctiveness from Norman England
After 1066, a stark cultural divide emerged between Norman England and Celtic Wales:

#### Welsh Characteristics
- **Clan-based social structures** with extended family (cenedl) obligations
- **Patronymic naming system** using "ap" (son of) and "ferch" (daughter of)
- **Oral tradition** preserved by bards and storytellers
- **Partible inheritance** among all acknowledged sons, including those born outside marriage
- **Celtic Christianity** with local saints and monastic traditions
- **Hill-fort centers** rather than urban settlements
- **Welsh language** (Brittonic Celtic) in all aspects of life

#### Norman-English Characteristics  
- **Feudal manorial system** with primogeniture inheritance
- **Fixed surnames** and Norman-French court language
- **Written legal tradition** with harsh corporal punishment
- **Centralized church** structure under Norman bishops
- **Urban development** and castle-based power centers

## ‚öñÔ∏è Welsh Law: Cyfraith Hywel

### The Laws of Hywel Dda (c. 948)
The defining feature of Welsh identity was its unique legal system, codified by Hywel Dda (Hywel the Good) around 948 at a grand assembly in Whitland.

#### Core Principles
- **Compensatory Justice**: Crimes resolved through galanas (blood-fines) and sarhad (honor-price) rather than execution
- **Women's Rights**: Unusually progressive for the era
  - Right to divorce under specific conditions (adultery, violence)
  - Compensation claims for domestic abuse
  - Marriage as civil contract, not indissoluble sacrament
- **Inheritance Equality**: Acknowledged illegitimate sons inherited equally with legitimate ones
- **Collective Responsibility**: Extended family (gwely) held communal land rights
- **Practical Justice**: Focus on restoration rather than punishment

#### Scandals and Norman Opposition
Archbishop John Pecham of Canterbury famously denounced Welsh law as "inspired by the devil" for allowing bastards to inherit. This inheritance practice shocked Norman churchmen but reflected Welsh values of kinship solidarity over strict legitimacy.
