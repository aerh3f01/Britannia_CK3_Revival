## üîß Core Systems

### üè∞ Title System (Landed Titles)

#### Welsh Kingdom Structure
```paradox
# File: common/landed_titles/01_be_landed_titles.txt

k_gwynedd = {
    color = { 135 25 3 }                    # Kingdom color on map
    capital = c_cardiganshire               # Kingdom capital
    
    ai_primary_priority = {                 # AI preference logic
        if = {
            limit = { culture = culture:welsh }
            add = @correct_culture_primary_score
        }
    }
    
    can_create = {                          # Creation requirements
        trigger_if = {
            culture = { has_cultural_pillar = heritage_brythonic }
        }
    }
    
    # Duchy definitions within kingdom
    d_gwynedd = {
        color = { 100 0 0 }
        capital = c_cardiganshire
        
        # County definitions within duchy
        c_cardiganshire = {
            color = { 110 10 0 }
            # Barony definitions within county
        }
    }
}
```

#### Technical Considerations
- **Color Consistency**: Welsh kingdoms use red-based color schemes
- **Historical Accuracy**: Capitals match historical seat of power
- **AI Behavior**: Cultural preferences ensure Welsh AI acts appropriately
- **Creation Logic**: Requirements reflect historical unification patterns

### üé≠ Event System

#### Event Structure Template
```paradox
# File: events/be_welsh_kingdom_events.txt

namespace = be_welsh_kingdom

be_welsh_kingdom.1001 = {
    type = character_event                   # Event type
    title = be_welsh_kingdom.1001.t         # Localization key for title
    desc = {                                 # Multiple description options
        desc = be_welsh_kingdom.1001.desc.intro
        triggered_desc = {                   # Conditional descriptions
            trigger = { has_trait = ambitious }
            desc = be_welsh_kingdom.1001.desc.ambitious
        }
    }
    theme = realm                           # Visual theme
    
    left_portrait = {                       # Character portraits
        character = scope:scoped_welsh_king
        animation = personality_honorable    # Character animation
    }
    
    immediate = {                           # Immediate effects
        play_music_cue = "mx_cue_epic_sacral_moment"
        save_scope_as = scoped_welsh_king
        create_welsh_kingdom_scripted_effect = yes
    }
    
    option = {                              # Player choice
        name = be_welsh_kingdom.1001.a      # Option text
        
        # Effects of choosing this option
        add_prestige = 500
        trigger_event = {
            id = be_welsh_kingdom.1002
            days = 30
        }
    }
    
    # Additional options...
}
```

#### Event Design Principles
- **Historical Context**: Each event based on documented history
- **Player Agency**: Meaningful choices with different outcomes
- **Cultural Authenticity**: Welsh values and customs reflected in options
- **Cascading Effects**: Events that trigger future event chains

### ‚öñÔ∏è Decision System

#### Decision Template
```paradox
# File: common/decisions/01_major_decisions_wales.txt

reunite_the_north_decision = {
    picture = "gfx/interface/illustrations/decisions/decision_realm.dds"
    major = yes                             # Major decision (appears prominently)
    ai_check_interval = 120                 # AI consideration frequency
    desc = reunite_the_north_decision_desc  # Description localization
    
    is_shown = {                            # When decision appears
        game_start_date = 1066.1.1          # Historical date restriction
        culture = culture:welsh              # Cultural requirement
        NOT = { exists = title:k_gwynedd.holder }  # Availability condition
    }
    
    is_valid_showing_failures_only = {      # Validation with error messages
        is_independent_ruler = yes
        is_at_war = no
        custom_description = {               # Custom validation message
            text = needs_welsh_heritage
            culture = { has_cultural_pillar = heritage_brythonic }
        }
    }
    
    effect = {                              # Decision consequences
        show_as_tooltip = {                 # Preview effects
            create_welsh_kingdom_scripted_effect = yes
        }
        trigger_event = {                   # Launch event chain
            id = be_welsh_kingdom.1001
        }
    }
    
    ai_will_do = {                          # AI decision-making logic
        base = 100
        
        modifier = {                        # AI preference modifiers
            factor = 2
            has_trait = ambitious
        }
        
        modifier = {
            factor = 0.5
            is_at_war = yes
        }
    }
}
```

### üéØ Scripted Effects & Triggers

#### Scripted Effects
```paradox
# File: common/scripted_effects/01_be_kingdom_effects.txt

create_welsh_kingdom_scripted_effect = {
    # Create the Kingdom of Wales title
    create_title = {
        tier = kingdom
        name = k_wales
        holder = this
    }
    
    # Add cultural bonuses
    add_character_modifier = {
        modifier = welsh_unity_bonus
        years = 10
    }
    
    # Trigger vassal reactions
    every_vassal = {
        limit = { culture = culture:welsh }
        add_opinion = {
            target = root
            modifier = unified_wales_opinion
            opinion = 20
        }
    }
    
    # Historical notification
    every_player = {
        trigger_event = {
            id = be_welsh_kingdom.9001  # World notification
        }
    }
}
```

#### Scripted Triggers
```paradox
# File: common/scripted_triggers/01_be_court_position_triggers.txt

is_suitable_welsh_bard_trigger = {
    culture = culture:welsh                  # Cultural requirement
    learning >= 10                          # Skill requirement
    OR = {
        has_trait = poet                     # Relevant traits
        has_trait = scholar
        has_trait = gregarious
    }
    NOT = { has_trait = shy }               # Disqualifying traits
    age >= 16                               # Age requirement
    is_imprisoned = no                      # Availability requirement
}

can_form_kingdom_of_wales_trigger = {
    culture = { has_cultural_pillar = heritage_brythonic }
    completely_controls = title:d_gwynedd
    completely_controls = title:d_powys
    OR = {
        completely_controls = title:d_deheubarth
        any_held_title = {
            tier = duchy
            title_province = { geographical_region = ghw_wales }
        }
    }
    prestige_level >= 3                     # Minimum prestige requirement
}
```

## üé® Localization System

### üìù Text File Structure
```yaml
# File: localization/replace/english/be_titles_l_english.yml

l_english:
 # Titles
 k_gwynedd:0 "Kingdom of Gwynedd"
 k_gwynedd_adj:0 "Gwynedd"
 d_gwynedd:0 "Duchy of Gwynedd"
 d_gwynedd_adj:0 "Gwynedd"
 
 # Characters
 owain_gwynedd:0 "Owain Gwynedd"
 owain_gwynedd_nickname:0 "the Great"
 
 # Events
 be_welsh_kingdom.1001.t:0 "The Crown of Wales"
 be_welsh_kingdom.1001.desc.intro:0 "The ancient kingdoms of Wales have long..."
 be_welsh_kingdom.1001.a:0 "A crown worthy of Cadwalader!"
 
 # Decisions

 reunite_the_north_decision_desc:0 "The scattered Welsh kingdoms..."
 
 # Custom descriptions
 needs_welsh_heritage:0 "Must be of Welsh heritage"
 unified_wales_opinion:0 "Unified Wales"
```

### üåç Localization Best Practices

#### Welsh Language Integration
```yaml
# Authentic Welsh terms with English explanations
pencerdd_court_position:0 "Pencerdd"
pencerdd_court_position_desc:0 "The Pencerdd (Chief Poet) holds the most prestigious..."

# Phonetic guides for non-Welsh speakers
llywelyn_pronunciation:0 "Llywelyn [HLOO-eh-lin]"

# Cultural context explanations
cyfraith_hywel:0 "Cyfraith Hywel (Law of Hywel Dda)"
cyfraith_hywel_tooltip:0 "Traditional Welsh legal system established by Hywel the Good"
```

#### Dynamic Text System
```yaml
# Context-sensitive descriptions
be_kingdom_formation.desc:1 "[CHARACTER.GetFirstName] stands before the assembled Welsh lords..."
be_kingdom_formation.desc:2 "In the shadow of Snowdon, [CHARACTER.GetFirstName] prepares..."

# Conditional text blocks
welsh_victory_notification:0 "[winner.GetTitledFirstName] has achieved a great victory against the [loser.GetCulture.GetName] forces at [county.GetName]!"
```

## üéØ Balance & Gameplay Design

### ‚öñÔ∏è Power Balance Considerations

#### Welsh Kingdom Strength
```paradox
# Balanced to be competitive but not overpowered
k_gwynedd = {
    # Moderate income base
    tax_mult = 1.0
    levy_mult = 1.1                         # Slight military advantage
    
    # Cultural bonuses
    culture = {
        martial_custom = martial_custom_mountain_warriors
        traditions = {
            tradition_hill_dwellers
            tradition_longbow_competitions
            tradition_poetry_competitions
        }
    }
}
```

#### Cultural Advantages & Disadvantages
```paradox
welsh_mountain_bonus = {
    supply_limit_mult = 0.1                 # Lower supply in mountains
    garrison_size = 0.2                     # Better castle defense
    hostile_county_attrition = 0.15        # Attrition for invaders
}

welsh_diplomatic_penalty = {
    same_culture_opinion = 10               # Welsh unity
    different_culture_opinion = -5         # Suspicion of foreigners
}
```

### üéÆ Player Experience Design

#### Progression Arcs
1. **Early Game**: Uniting fragmented Welsh kingdoms
2. **Mid Game**: Resisting Norman expansion
3. **Late Game**: Welsh cultural renaissance or English integration

#### Meaningful Choices
- **Cultural Preservation vs. Adaptation**: Maintain traditions or modernize
- **Independence vs. Accommodation**: Resist or work with English overlords
- **Military vs. Diplomatic**: Warrior culture or political maneuvering
- **Religious Path**: Celtic Christianity vs. Roman Catholicism

```paradox
# Efficient scripting practices
every_county = {
    limit = { 
        culture = culture:welsh          # Narrow scope early
        county_opinion <= 0             # Specific conditions
    }
    # Minimal operations within loop
}

# Avoid expensive operations in frequently called events
trigger_event = {
    id = be_performance_check.0001
    days = { 365 730 }                  # Yearly events only
}
```

#### Memory Management
- **Scope Management**: Properly save and clear character scopes
- **Event Cleanup**: Remove temporary modifiers and flags
- **Trigger Optimization**: Use most restrictive conditions first
- **Loop Efficiency**: Minimize operations within large loops
